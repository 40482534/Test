                    Tarot cards were originally evented in the 14th century in Europe. Very little is known about the original origin, appearance and number of Tarot cards. The most significant thing is that the deck consists of 4 suits, with an early pattern consisting of clubs, coins, swords and cups, which are traditional suits still used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese decks of cards. The earliest cards were hand-painted cards which rich Italian families would have commissioned to play card games.

                    The tarot decks used to have a very Christian theme, but this has been toned down over time. The design for each card has remained consistent in most modern decks. One of the most popular decks is the Rider-Waite deck, which has been adapted by many artists to make very unique decks of cards while always consisting of the same details and positioning. The recreation of these cards build a vibrant depiction of this evolving art form.
                    Modern decks of tarot cards consist of 78 cards, being a combination of major and minor arcana. The Major arcana describe spiritual matters and important trends in questioner’s life, where as the Minor arcana deal with business matters and career ambitions. The cards’ meanings are modified depending on whether it is upside down, its position in the spread and meaning of adjacent cards.
